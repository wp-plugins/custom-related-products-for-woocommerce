Custom Related Products for WooCommerce lets you choose which products should show in the related products area on a product detail page.

== Description ==

Custom Related Products for WooCommerce lets you choose which products should show in the related products area on a product detail page instead of simply showing products from the same category. Take control of your detail views and show the products that you want!

How to use:
* Edit any product and under Linked Products you will have a Related Products selector alongside the Cross-Sells and Upsells.
* Select some products and save.
* As long as your theme has a related products section, you're done! By default all WooCommerce themes have this, so unless your theme specifically disables it you're all set.
* If you don't select related products for any product, it will fall back to the WooCommerce default behavior of selecting random products by category. If you'd prefer to show no products you can configure that under WooCommerce > Custom Related Products.

This plugin has been tested with WooCommerce 2.1, 2.3, and 2.3
